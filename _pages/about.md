I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.

I hold multiple industry certifications including Google Cybersecurity, Professional and ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, as I prepare to take CompTIA Security + and Splunk Core User certifications.

Through practical labs and self-directed projects I've gained hands-on experience in SOC Operations, Incident Response, and Vulnerability Management. I'm passionate about Identity and Access Management, Threat Detection, and Digital Forensics; with a strong technical foundation in scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell,  and JavaScript), cloud technologies (Azure), and virtualization platforms.

I'm excited to leverage my experience and ready to contribute to a dynamic team while leveraging my investigative insight gained through safety audits and root cause investigations alongside my technical cybersecurity knowledge.
